        summary: 'How we got here and why data mining matters.',
        story:
          'Imagine a small retailer in the 1990s analyzing checkout receipts. By grouping items bought together across thousands of transactions, they uncover surprising product pairings. This “market basket analysis” wasn’t about fancy models—it was about letting patterns in the data speak. Around the same time, the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) community and the CRISP-DM methodology emerged to turn raw data into useful knowledge, step by step.',
        concept:
          'Data mining is the process of discovering useful, non-trivial patterns from data to support decisions. It overlaps with statistics (inference) and machine learning (prediction), but focuses on pattern discovery, actionable insights, and decision support. Why mine data? Data is exploding: from 1TB in 2000 to 30TB+ in 2025. We need automated methods to handle volume, velocity, and variety. Applications: personalized recommendations, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, customer segmentation. Milestones: 1960s–80s databases and OLAP; late 1980s KDD workshops; late 1990s CRISP-DM; 2000s “big data” and distributed systems; 2010s deep learning influences. Common goals: association discovery (what co-occurs), classification (predict labels), clustering (group similar items), anomaly detection (find outliers).',
        exercise:
          'Do-now: List three data sources around you (apps, sensors, logs). For each, state one possible pattern (association, classification, clustering, anomaly) that could create value. Example: streaming app logs → anomaly detection to flag login fraud.',
